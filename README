Ti-Bobble was a project I did in high school. It is a clone of the classic
Nintendo Game Bubble Bobble (tm) for the TI-85 line of graphing calculators.
There are 21 levels of mayhem. There is also a save feature that will save the
last level that you made it to.

This program was written in Z80 assembly language. It was designed to run
under Z-SHELL. Z-SHELL is basically a bootloader for the calculator, that
handles loading your program into memory. It also has a file named ZSHELL.H
which has some useful macros.

When I originally developed this, I compiled under DOS with Borland Turbo
Assembler.

I hope you enjoy playing this on your TI calculator-- or at least taking a
glance at some pretty gnarly assembly source code!
Have fun.

sincerely,
Colin Patrick McCabe
